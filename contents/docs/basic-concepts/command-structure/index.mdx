### Command Structure

Every Bash command follows a basic structure:

```bash
command [options] [arguments]
```

Let's break this down:

1. **Command**  
   - The program or action you want to run
   - Must be typed exactly (remember: case-sensitive)
   - Examples: `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`

2. **Options (Flags)**  
   - Modify how the command behaves
   - Start with `-` (short form) or `--` (long form)
   - Examples:
     - `ls -l` (long format)
     - `ls --all` (show hidden files)
   - Can be combined: `ls -la`

3. **Arguments**  
   - What the command acts upon
   - Usually files, directories, or text
   - Examples:
     - `cd Documents`
     - `mkdir Projects`

### Real Examples

```bash
# Simple command
ls

# Command with option
ls -l

# Command with argument
cd Documents

# Command with option and argument
cp -r Documents Backup

# Command with multiple options and arguments
ls -la Documents Downloads
```

### Reading Command Help

When you see command documentation:
- Square brackets `[ ]` mean optional
- Vertical bar `|` means "or"
- Angle brackets `< >` mean required

Example from documentation:
```bash
cp [-r] <source> <destination>
```
This means:
- `-r` is optional
- Both source and destination are required

Remember: Most commands accept `--help` or `-h` to show basic usage information.
