### What is the Command Line?

The command line, also known as terminal or shell, is a text-based interface to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking buttons and navigating menus, you type commands to perform actions like creating files, installing programs, or managing system processes.

### Basic Terminal Concepts

1. **The Prompt**  
   When you open your terminal, you'll see something like:
   ```bash
   username@hostname:~$
   ```
   - `username`: Your user account
   - `hostname`: Your computer's name
   - `~`: Current directory (~ means home directory)
   - `$`: Regular user prompt (# for root user)

2. **Working Directory**  
   - The directory (folder) you're currently in
   - Always shown in your prompt
   - Important context for your commands

3. **Case Sensitivity**  
   - Linux commands are case-sensitive
   - `Documents` and `documents` are different
   - Most commands are written in lowercase

4. **Spaces in Commands**  
   - Spaces separate command components
   - Use quotes or backslashes for filenames with spaces
   - Example: `cd "My Documents"` or `cd My\ Documents`

### Basic Terminal Navigation

- Use arrow keys to navigate command history
- Press Tab for command/filename auto-completion
- Press Ctrl+C to cancel a running command
- Press Ctrl+L or type `clear` to clear the screen

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Forgetting about case sensitivity
- Not using quotes for filenames with spaces
- Running commands from the wrong directory
- Copying commands without understanding them

Remember: The command line becomes more intuitive with practice. Start with basic commands and gradually build your confidence.
