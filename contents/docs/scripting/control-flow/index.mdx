### Overview

Control flow statements in Bash allow you to make decisions, execute commands conditionally, and create logical branches in your scripts. The main constructs are if statements, case statements, and test conditions.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Basic if statement
if [ condition ]; then
    command
fi

# if-else statement
if [ condition ]; then
    command1
else
    command2
fi
```

**Example**:
```bash
if [ "$age" -ge 18 ]; then
    echo "Adult"
else
    echo "Minor"
fi
```
- Checks if age is greater than or equal to 18

---

### Common Constructs

1. **if-elif-else**  
   ```bash
   if [ condition1 ]; then
       command1
   elif [ condition2 ]; then
       command2
   else
       command3
   fi
   ```

2. **case Statement**  
   ```bash
   case "$variable" in
       pattern1)
           command1
           ;;
       pattern2)
           command2
           ;;
       *)
           default_command
           ;;
   esac
   ```

3. **Test Conditions**  
   ```bash
   # File tests
   [ -f file ]     # File exists and is regular file
   [ -d dir ]      # Directory exists
   
   # String tests
   [ -z string ]   # String is empty
   [ -n string ]   # String is not empty
   
   # Numeric comparisons
   [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]  # Equal to
   [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]  # Less than
   ```

---

### Examples

1. **Check File Existence**  
   ```bash
   if [ -f "config.txt" ]; then
       echo "Config file exists"
   else
       echo "Config file not found"
   fi
   ```

2. **Menu System**  
   ```bash
   case "$choice" in
       1)
           echo "Selected option 1"
           ;;
       2)
           echo "Selected option 2"
           ;;
       *)
           echo "Invalid option"
           ;;
   esac
   ```

3. **Multiple Conditions**  
   ```bash
   if [ "$age" -ge 18 ] && [ "$has_id" = true ]; then
       echo "Access granted"
   else
       echo "Access denied"
   fi
   ```

### Tips and Best Practices

- Always quote variables in conditions
- Use appropriate test operators
- Double brackets [[ ]] for advanced operations
- Indent code blocks for readability
- Consider using case for multiple conditions
- Test your conditions thoroughly
