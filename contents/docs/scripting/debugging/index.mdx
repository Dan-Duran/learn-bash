### Overview

Debugging in Bash scripts involves finding and fixing errors using various tools and techniques. Bash provides several built-in options and commands that help track down issues, from simple print statements to detailed execution tracing.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Enable debug mode
bash -x script.sh

# Debug specific section
set -x  # Start debugging
commands
set +x  # Stop debugging
```

**Example**:
```bash
set -x
echo "Debug this section"
ls non_existent_file
set +x
```
- Shows detailed execution information for the commands

---

### Common Techniques

1. **Debug Options**  
   ```bash
   set -e  # Exit on error
   set -v  # Print input lines
   set -x  # Print commands
   set -u  # Error on undefined variables
   ```

2. **Print Statements**  
   ```bash
   echo "DEBUG: variable=$variable"
   printf "DEBUG: %s\n" "$value"
   ```

3. **Trace Functions**  
   ```bash
   function debug() {
       echo "DEBUG: $*" >&2
   }
   debug "Current value: $value"
   ```

---

### Examples

1. **Basic Debugging**  
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash -x
   # Entire script runs in debug mode
   for i in {1..3}; do
       echo "Loop $i"
   done
   ```

2. **Selective Debug**  
   ```bash
   echo "Normal execution"
   set -x
   # Debug this section
   critical_function
   set +x
   echo "Back to normal"
   ```

3. **Debug Function**  
   ```bash
   debug() {
       [ "$DEBUG" = "true" ] && echo "DEBUG: $*"
   }
   DEBUG=true
   debug "Testing connection"
   ```

### Tips and Best Practices

- Use appropriate debug levels
- Comment debug code properly
- Clean up debug statements
- Use meaningful debug messages
- Test with sample data
- Log debug information
- Review debug output carefully
