### Overview

Loops in Bash allow you to execute a set of commands repeatedly. Bash provides several types of loops: for, while, and until. Each serves different purposes and can be used to iterate over lists, process files, or run commands based on conditions.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
# For loop
for item in list; do
    command
done

# While loop
while [ condition ]; do
    command
done
```

**Example**:
```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```
- Prints each number in the sequence

### Common Types

1. **For Loop**  
   ```bash
   # Basic sequence
   for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
       echo "$i"
   done

   # C-style
   for ((i=0; i<5; i++)); do
       echo "$i"
   done
   ```

2. **While Loop**  
   ```bash
   count=0
   while [ $count -lt 5 ]; do
       echo "$count"
       ((count++))
   done
   ```

3. **Until Loop**  
   ```bash
   count=0
   until [ $count -ge 5 ]; do
       echo "$count"
       ((count++))
   done
   ```

### Examples

1. **Process Files**  
   ```bash
   for file in *.txt; do
       echo "Processing $file"
       cat "$file"
   done
   ```

2. **Read File Line by Line**  
   ```bash
   while read -r line; do
       echo "Line: $line"
   done < input.txt
   ```

3. **Infinite Loop**  
   ```bash
   while true; do
       echo "Press q to quit"
       read input
       if [ "$input" = "q" ]; then
           break
       fi
   done
   ```

### Tips and Best Practices

- Quote variables in conditions
- Use meaningful loop variables
- Avoid infinite loops
- Include break/continue when needed
- Control loop output
- Test loop conditions
- Use appropriate loop type for task
