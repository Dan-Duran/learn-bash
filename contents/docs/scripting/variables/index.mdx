### Overview

Variables in Bash are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout your script. They can hold strings, numbers, arrays, and command outputs. All variables in Bash are stored internally as strings.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Assignment (no spaces around =)
name="John"
age=25

# Reference with $
echo "$name is $age years old"
```
**Example**:
```bash
greeting="Hello"
name="World"
echo "$greeting, $name!"
```
- Assigns values to variables and prints "Hello, World!"

---

### Common Types

1. **String Variables**  
   ```bash
   message="Hello World"
   name='John Doe'      # Single or double quotes
   ```

2. **Numeric Variables**  
   ```bash
   count=42
   price=9.99          # Still stored as string
   ```

3. **Arrays**  
   ```bash
   colors=("red" "blue" "green")
   echo "${colors[0]}"  # Access first element
   ```

4. **Command Substitution**  
   ```bash
   current_date=$(date)
   files_count=$(ls | wc -l)
   ```

---

### Examples

1. **User Input**  
   ```bash
   echo "What's your name?"
   read username
   echo "Hello, $username!"
   ```

2. **Command Result**  
   ```bash
   uptime=$(uptime -p)
   echo "System has been up for: $uptime"
   ```

3. **Arithmetic**  
   ```bash
   x=5
   y=3
   sum=$((x + y))
   echo "Sum is: $sum"
   ```

4. **Array Operations**  
   ```bash
   fruits=("apple" "banana" "orange")
   echo "First fruit: ${fruits[0]}"
   echo "All fruits: ${fruits[@]}"
   ```

### Tips and Best Practices

- Always quote variable references: "$variable"
- Use meaningful variable names
- Variables are case-sensitive
- Avoid spaces in assignments
- Use readonly for constants
- Clear variables when no longer needed
- Use local variables in functions
