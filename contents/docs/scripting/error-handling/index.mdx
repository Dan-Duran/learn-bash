### Overview

Error handling in Bash scripts is crucial for creating robust and reliable scripts. It involves detecting errors, handling exceptions, and ensuring your script fails gracefully when something goes wrong. Proper error handling helps in debugging and maintains script reliability.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Exit on error
set -e

# Basic error check
if ! command; then
    echo "Error occurred"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Example**:
```bash
if ! mkdir new_directory; then
    echo "Failed to create directory"
    exit 1
fi
```
- Attempts to create a directory and handles potential failure

### Common Techniques

1. **Exit Codes**  
   ```bash
   # Check last command status
   command
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
       echo "Command failed"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Error Trapping**  
   ```bash
   # Set error trap
   trap 'echo "Error on line $LINENO"' ERR
   
   # Cleanup on exit
   trap 'cleanup_function' EXIT
   ```

3. **Set Options**  
   ```bash
   set -e  # Exit on error
   set -u  # Exit on undefined variable
   set -x  # Print commands for debugging
   ```

---

### Examples

1. **Function Error Handling**  
   ```bash
   process_file() {
       if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
           echo "Error: File not found" >&2
           return 1
       fi
       cat "$1"
       return 0
   }
   ```

2. **Command Validation**  
   ```bash
   command_exists() {
       command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
   }

   if ! command_exists git; then
       echo "Error: git is not installed"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. **Cleanup on Error**  
   ```bash
   cleanup() {
       rm -f temp_file
       echo "Cleanup completed"
   }
   trap cleanup EXIT

   # Rest of script
   ```
