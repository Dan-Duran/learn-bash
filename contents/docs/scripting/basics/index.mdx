### Overview

Bash scripting allows you to automate tasks by combining commands, control structures, and variables into reusable scripts. A script is essentially a text file containing a series of commands that the shell executes in sequence.

---

### Basic Script Structure

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Comments start with #
# First, define variables
name="World"

# Then add your commands
echo "Hello, $name!"

# Exit with a status code
exit 0
```

- Every script should start with a shebang
- Comments help document your code
- Commands execute in order, top to bottom
- Exit codes indicate success (0) or failure (non-zero)

### Common Elements

1. **Running Scripts**  
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh    # Make executable
   ./script.sh          # Run script
   bash script.sh       # Alternative method
   ```

2. **Comments**  
   ```bash
   # Single line comment
   echo "Hello" # End of line comment
   ```

3. **Variables**  
   ```bash
   name="John"          # No spaces around =
   echo "Hello, $name"  # Use $ to reference
   ```

4. **Command Output**  
   ```bash
   current_date=$(date)  # Command substitution
   echo "Today is $current_date"
   ```

### Examples

1. **Simple Backup Script**  
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   source_dir="/home/user/documents"
   backup_dir="/backup"
   
   cp -r "$source_dir" "$backup_dir"
   echo "Backup completed!"
   ```

2. **Welcome Message**  
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Welcome to the system!"
   date
   echo "Currently logged in as: $(whoami)"
   ```

3. **Basic System Info**  
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Memory Usage:"
   free -h
   echo "Disk Space:"
   df -h
   ```

### Tips and Best Practices

- Always start with a shebang line
- Make scripts executable before running
- Use meaningful variable names
- Quote your variables when using them
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Keep scripts modular and focused
- Test scripts before using in production
