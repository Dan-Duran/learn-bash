### Overview

The **shebang** (also known as hashbang) is a special line at the beginning of a script that tells the system which interpreter to use for executing the script. It always starts with `#!` followed by the path to the interpreter.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
**Example**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
- The script will execute using the bash interpreter located at `/bin/bash`

Without a shebang, the script would run with the default shell, which might not be bash.

---

### Common Options

1. **`#!/bin/sh`**  
   - Uses the system's default shell (usually a simpler shell)
   - More portable but fewer features

2. **`#!/usr/bin/env bash`**  
   - Uses the first bash in the user's PATH
   - More portable across different Unix-like systems
   - Recommended for most bash scripts

3. **`#!/bin/bash -x`**  
   - Runs bash in debug mode
   - Prints each command before execution

4. **`#!/bin/bash -e`**  
   - Exits on any error
   - Good for catching script failures

---

### Examples

1. **Basic Script**  
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "This is a bash script"
   ```

2. **Portable Script**  
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   echo "This will find bash in PATH"
   ```

3. **Debug Mode**  
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash -x
   echo "Watch each command execute"
   ```

4. **Exit on Error**  
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash -e
   echo "Script will stop if any command fails"
   ```

### Tips and Best Practices

- Always include a shebang in your scripts
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for better portability
- Add script permissions with `chmod +x script.sh`
- Choose the right interpreter for your needs
- Comment the shebang choice if it's not obvious
