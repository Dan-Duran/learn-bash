### Overview

Input/Output (I/O) in Bash involves reading input from users or files and writing output to the screen or files. Bash provides various methods to handle I/O operations, including standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr).

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Read user input
read variable_name

# Write output
echo "Some text"

# Write to file
echo "content" > file.txt
```

**Example**:
```bash
echo "What's your name?"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```
- Prompts for user input and displays a greeting

### Common Operations

1. **Read Input**  
   ```bash
   # Basic read
   read answer
   
   # Read with prompt
   read -p "Enter value: " input
   
   # Read with timeout
   read -t 5 response
   
   # Read password (hidden input)
   read -s password
   ```

2. **Write Output**  
   ```bash
   # To stdout
   echo "Normal output"
   
   # To stderr
   echo "Error message" >&2
   
   # To file
   echo "Log entry" >> logfile.txt
   ```

3. **File Operations**  
   ```bash
   # Read file content
   while IFS= read -r line; do
       echo "$line"
   done < input.txt
   
   # Write multiple lines
   cat << EOF > output.txt
   Line 1
   Line 2
   EOF
   ```

---

### Examples

1. **Interactive Script**  
   ```bash
   read -p "Username: " username
   read -sp "Password: " password
   echo
   echo "Welcome, $username!"
   ```

2. **Process File Input**  
   ```bash
   while IFS=, read -r name age; do
       echo "Name: $name, Age: $age"
   done < users.csv
   ```

3. **Logging**  
   ```bash
   log_message() {
       echo "[$(date)]: $1" >> app.log
   }
   log_message "Script started"
   ```
