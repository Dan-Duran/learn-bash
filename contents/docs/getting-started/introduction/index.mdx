### A Note About Shells
While this guide focuses on Bash (Bourne Again Shell), there are other popular shell environments like Zsh (default on macOS), Fish, and Ksh. Most commands and concepts you'll learn here work across these shells, with minor syntax differences. We chose Bash for this guide because it's the default shell in most Linux distributions and remains the standard in enterprise environments.

Feel free to jump around the sections, but we recommend following them in order for the most cohesive learning experience.
