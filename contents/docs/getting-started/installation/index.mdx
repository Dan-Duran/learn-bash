### Installation

Depending on your operating system, installing or accessing Bash can be straightforward:

**Linux:**  
- Most distributions come with Bash pre-installed.  
- You can verify by opening a terminal and running `bash --version`.  

**macOS:**  
- Bash is included by default, though newer macOS versions may ship with Zsh as the default shell.  
- If desired, you can install a newer version of Bash via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):  
  ```bash
  brew install bash
  ```
- Update your login shell by editing `/etc/shells` and running `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash`.  

**Windows:**  
- Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) to use Git Bash, which provides a Bash-like terminal.  
- Alternatively, install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (WSL) to run a full Linux environment on Windows.  

After installation, open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and verify with:
```bash
bash --version
```
