### Overview

The `df` command (short for *disk free*) displays information about the available and used disk space on your mounted file systems. By default, it shows the usage in 1-kilobyte blocks and lists each file system with its mount point.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
df
```
- Prints disk space usage for all currently mounted file systems.

---

### Human-Readable Output (`-h`)

```bash
df -h
```
- Shows sizes in a human-readable format (e.g., KB, MB, GB).
- Often the most commonly used option, making disk usage easier to interpret.

---

### Specifying a File System or Path

```bash
df /path/to/directory
```
- Displays information for the file system on which the directory resides.

```bash
df -h /dev/sda1
```
- Shows usage for a specific device or partition.

---

### Including File System Type (`-T`)

```bash
df -T
```
- Adds a column to indicate the file system type (e.g., ext4, xfs, tmpfs).

---

### Inodes Usage (`-i`)

```bash
df -i
```
- Shows information about inodes (index nodes) instead of block usage. 
- If you have many small files, you could run out of inodes before disk space.

---

### Excluding or Including Certain File Systems

- **`-x`** *type*  
  ```bash
  df -x tmpfs
  ```
  Excludes file systems of type `tmpfs`.
- **`-t`** *type*  
  ```bash
  df -t ext4
  ```
  Shows only `ext4` file systems.

---

### Examples

1. **Standard, All File Systems**  
   ```bash
   df
   ```
   Prints usage in 1K blocks for everything mounted.

2. **Human-Readable for All File Systems**  
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```
   Displays usage in KB, MB, or GB for each mount point.

3. **Disk Usage for a Specific Directory**  
   ```bash
   df -h /home/dan
   ```
   Shows usage of the file system containing `/home/dan`.

4. **Show Inode Usage**  
   ```bash
   df -i
   ```
   Displays how many inodes are used and free on each file system.

5. **Show File System Type**  
   ```bash
   df -hT
   ```
   Combines human-readable format with a column for file system type.

6. **Exclude tmpfs**  
   ```bash
   df -h -x tmpfs
   ```
   Displays usage for all mounted file systems except those mounted as `tmpfs`.

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Combine with Other Commands**: Pair `df` with `du` (disk usage) for a fuller picture of disk consumption. `df` shows the file system summary, while `du` can drill down into directory sizes.
- **Watch for Full Partitions**: Regularly check `df -h` to ensure you have enough space. Running out of disk space can cause system instability.
- **Inode Constraints**: If `df -i` shows a high inode usage (100%), you might need to remove or consolidate numerous small files.
- **Scripting**: Use `df -h | grep /mountpoint` in scripts to programmatically check for low disk space and send alerts if thresholds are exceeded.
- **Network Filesystems**: When working with NFS or other network-mounted storage, check if `df` output is accurate. Sometimes network issues or permissions can cause inaccurate or delayed data.
