### Overview

The `help` command displays information about Bash's built-in commands. Unlike `man` which shows external command documentation, `help` is specifically for commands that are part of the shell itself.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
help [pattern]
```
- Without arguments, lists all available shell commands
- With a pattern, shows detailed help for matching commands
  ```bash
  help cd
  ```
  Views the documentation for the `cd` built-in command.

### Common Options

- `-d`: Output short description for each topic
- `-m`: Display usage in pseudo-manpage format
- `-s`: Output only a short usage synopsis
- `-i`: Output in a format designed for Info readers

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Quick Reference**: The `-d` option is perfect for quick command lookups
- **Man-style Reading**: Use `-m` when you prefer the traditional man page format
- **Verification**: Use `type command` to check if something is a built-in
- **Comprehensive Help**: Combine with `man` and `info` for complete documentation
