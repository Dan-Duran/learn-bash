### Overview

The `curl` (client URL) command is a versatile tool for transferring data to and from servers. It supports a wide range of protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, etc.), making it invaluable for tasks like downloading files, troubleshooting APIs, and sending custom requests.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
curl https://example.com
```
- Fetches the HTML content of `https://example.com` and prints it to standard output.  
- By default, `curl` uses an HTTP `GET` request if no other method is specified.

```bash
curl -O https://example.com/file.zip
```
- Saves the file (`file.zip`) with the same name as the remote server provides.
- **`-O`**: Write output to a file with the remote filename.

---

### Common Options

1. **Download to a Specific File (`-o`)**  
   ```bash
   curl -o local_file.zip https://example.com/file.zip
   ```
   Names the downloaded file `local_file.zip`.

2. **Show Headers Only (`-I`)**  
   ```bash
   curl -I https://example.com
   ```
   Retrieves only HTTP headers (e.g., server type, content type, etc.).

3. **Follow Redirects (`-L`)**  
   ```bash
   curl -L http://example.com
   ```
   Follows any HTTP 3xx redirects until it reaches the final destination.

4. **Include Response Headers in Output (`-i`)**  
   ```bash
   curl -i https://example.com
   ```
   Shows both HTTP headers and the body in the output.

5. **Silent Mode (`-s`)**  
   ```bash
   curl -s https://example.com
   ```
   Suppresses the progress meter and error messages (useful for scripting).

6. **Verbose Mode (`-v`)**  
   ```bash
   curl -v https://example.com
   ```
   Prints detailed information about the request and response (great for debugging).

7. **Limit Rate of Transfer (`--limit-rate`)**  
   ```bash
   curl --limit-rate 100k https://example.com/file.iso -O
   ```
   Caps the download speed to 100 KB/s.

### Using HTTP Methods

```bash
# POST request
curl -X POST -d "param1=value1&param2=value2" https://example.com/api
```
- **`-X POST`**: Explicitly sets the HTTP method to POST.  
- **`-d`**: Sends the provided data in the request body.  

```bash
# PUT request
curl -X PUT -d '{"name":"Dan"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://example.com/users/1
```
- Sends JSON data with a `PUT` request.  
- **`-H`** sets the `Content-Type` header.

---

### Authentication

1. **Basic Authentication**  
   ```bash
   curl -u username:password https://example.com/protected
   ```
   Encodes credentials in the `Authorization` header.  

2. **Bearer Tokens**  
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://example.com/api
   ```
   Sends an OAuth or JWT token in the header.

3. **Digest Authentication**  
   ```bash
   curl --digest -u username:password https://example.com/protected
   ```
   Uses Digest auth instead of Basic.

---

### Uploading Files

```bash
curl -F "file=@/path/to/file.jpg" https://example.com/upload
```
- **`-F`**: Uses multipart/form-data.  
- The `@` symbol indicates a file to upload.

---

### Examples

1. **Download a File and Rename**  
   ```bash
   curl -o myfile.txt https://example.com/data.txt
   ```
   Saves `data.txt` to `myfile.txt`.

2. **View Only Headers**  
   ```bash
   curl -I -s https://example.com
   ```
   Quietly fetches just the HTTP response headers.

3. **Follow Redirects and Show Progress**  
   ```bash
   curl -L -O https://example.com/redirected-file
   ```
   Automatically follows redirects and saves the final file, keeping the same name as on the server.

4. **Upload Using Form Data**  
   ```bash
   curl -F "username=dan" -F "file=@/home/dan/pic.png" https://example.com/upload
   ```
   Sends form data with a file attached.

5. **POST JSON Data**  
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"msg":"Hello World!"}' \
        https://api.example.com/messages
   ```
   Sends a JSON object in the body of a POST request.

6. **Use a Proxy**  
   ```bash
   curl -x http://proxy.example.com:8080 https://example.com
   ```
   Routes the request through a proxy server.

7. **Set a User Agent**  
   ```bash
   curl -A "MyCustomAgent/1.0" https://example.com
   ```
   Customizes the `User-Agent` header to mimic or identify a specific client.

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Test APIs Quickly**: Curl is perfect for verifying endpoints in REST APIs. Combined with JSON data (`-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d …`), you can simulate requests from the command line.
- **Scripting**: Use `-s` for silent mode and `-o` or `-O` to control how data is saved. Parse output with tools like `jq` (for JSON) or `grep`.
- **Verbose Mode**: When requests fail, use `-v` or `--trace`/`--trace-ascii` for deeper inspection of headers and data.
- **TLS/SSL**: If you encounter SSL certificate errors, you can bypass them with `-k` (insecure), though it’s better to fix certificates in production environments.
- **Rate Limiting**: In automation scripts, `--limit-rate` helps prevent saturating bandwidth or overwhelming a server.
- **Authentication Handling**: Sensitive credentials should be stored securely or passed via environment variables rather than hard-coded in scripts.
