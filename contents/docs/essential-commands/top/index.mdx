### Overview

The `top` command provides a real-time, dynamic view of the running processes on your system. It displays system resource usage (CPU, memory, load averages) and allows you to interactively manage or kill processes.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
top
```
- Launches the interactive process viewer.  
- By default, it sorts processes by CPU usage (highest first).  
- Press `q` to quit.

---

### Key Information Displayed

1. **System Summary** (top of the screen)  
   - **Uptime**: How long the system has been running.  
   - **Load Averages**: Average number of processes waiting to run over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.  
   - **Tasks**: Number of processes running, sleeping, stopped, or zombie.  
   - **CPU Usage**: Percentages of user, system, idle, I/O wait, etc.  
   - **Memory Usage**: Total, used, free, buffers, and cache.  

2. **Process List** (below the summary)  
   - **PID**: Process ID.  
   - **USER**: Owner of the process.  
   - **PR** / **NI**: Process priority / nice value.  
   - **VIRT** / **RES** / **SHR**: Virtual, resident, and shared memory used by the process.  
   - **%CPU** / **%MEM**: CPU and memory usage percentage.  
   - **TIME+**: Total CPU time the process has consumed.  
   - **COMMAND**: The command used to run the process.

---

### Interactive Controls

While `top` is running, you can press various keys to change the display or perform actions:

- **k**: Prompt for a PID to kill. Enter the PID and optionally a signal (default is SIGTERM).  
- **r**: Prompt for a PID to renice. Adjust the priority of a running process.  
- **h** or **?**: Show help menu with all shortcuts.  
- **Space** or **Enter**: Refresh the display immediately.  
- **Arrow Keys** (or **Page Up/Down**): Scroll through the list of processes (depending on your terminal).  
- **q**: Quit `top`.

---

### Sorting and Fields

- Press **F** or **o** to enter the field management menu.  
- Use **Up/Down** arrows to select a field, and **`d`** to toggle whether it’s displayed.  
- Press **s** to sort by a selected field.  
- Press **q** to return to the main display.

Alternatively, shortcuts like **\<** or **>** can shift the sort column left or right (depending on the distribution).

---

### Changing Refresh Interval (`-d`)

```bash
top -d 2
```
- Updates the display every 2 seconds instead of the default (usually 3 seconds).

---

### Batch Mode (Non-Interactive)

```bash
top -b -n 1
```
- Runs `top` in batch mode for one iteration, then exits.  
- Useful in scripts to capture a snapshot of running processes:
  ```bash
  top -b -n 1 | grep python
  ```
  Filters the output for processes containing “python”.

---

### Examples

1. **Run in Batch Mode and Sort by Memory**  
   ```bash
   top -b -o +%MEM -n 1
   ```
   Produces a single snapshot (`-n 1`) sorted by memory usage (`-o +%MEM`).

2. **Specify Refresh Interval**  
   ```bash
   top -d 5
   ```
   Updates every 5 seconds, making it less CPU-intensive for monitoring.

3. **Kill a Process**  
   - Press `k` during `top`, type in the PID, then press **Enter**.  
   - If no signal is specified, it defaults to `SIGTERM`.

4. **Renice a Process**  
   - Press `r`, type in the PID, and specify a new nice value (e.g., 10 to lower its priority).

5. **Show Help**  
   - Press `h` (or `?`) inside `top` for a quick reference to all interactive commands.

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Real-Time System Monitoring**: Use `top` for a quick overview of CPU/memory usage. For more advanced functionality (like color-coded output or better interaction), try `htop` or `glances`.  
- **Batch Mode for Logging**: Automate performance snapshots using `top -b` in scripts or cron jobs.  
- **Sort by Different Fields**: Press `F`, then choose the field to sort by (e.g., `%MEM`) to quickly locate memory-heavy processes.  
- **Interact Safely**: Be cautious when killing processes from `top`. Always verify the PID and process name.  
- **Refresh Interval**: Increase the delay (`top -d <seconds>`) if you don’t need frequent updates, reducing overhead on busy systems.  
- **Customization**: The `.toprc` file in your home directory (for many distros) stores configurations, like default fields or sort order, if you choose to save your `top` settings.
