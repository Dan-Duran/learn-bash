### Overview

The `grep` (global regular expression print) command allows you to search text or entire files for lines that match a pattern. It’s one of the most powerful tools for finding specific strings or patterns in logs, configuration files, or any text data.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
grep pattern filename
```
- Searches `filename` for lines containing `pattern` and prints them.

```bash
grep 'error' /var/log/syslog
```
- Displays lines containing the word "error" in `/var/log/syslog`.

---

### Case Sensitivity

By default, `grep` is case-sensitive. Use `-i` (ignore case) to make it case-insensitive:
```bash
grep -i 'error' /var/log/syslog
```
- Matches "error", "Error", "ERROR", etc.

---

### Searching Multiple Files

```bash
grep 'main' file1.c file2.c file3.c
```
- Searches for "main" in each file and prints matching lines from all files.

Or you can use wildcards:
```bash
grep 'TODO' *.txt
```
- Looks for "TODO" in all `.txt` files in the current directory.

---

### Recursive Search (`-r`)

Use `-r` to search through directories and their subdirectories:
```bash
grep -r 'TODO' /path/to/code
```
- Prints matches for "TODO" from all files in `/path/to/code` and below.

To skip binary files and only search in text files, add the `-I` option:
```bash
grep -rI 'TODO' /path/to/code
```

---

### Matching Whole Words (`-w`)

```bash
grep -w 'foo' myfile.txt
```
- Matches only lines where "foo" is a standalone word. 
- It won’t match strings like "foobar" or "infoo".

---

### Invert Match (`-v`)

```bash
grep -v 'error' server.log
```
- Prints all lines **not** containing "error" in `server.log`.

---

### Line Numbers (`-n`)

```bash
grep -n 'ERROR' /var/log/syslog
```
- Includes the line number for each match, making it easier to locate the matched line in the file.

---

### Context Lines (`-C`, `-A`, `-B`)

Sometimes it’s helpful to see lines before and/or after the match:

- **`-C NUM`**: Shows `NUM` lines of context before and after each match.
- **`-A NUM`**: Shows `NUM` lines **after** each match.
- **`-B NUM`**: Shows `NUM` lines **before** each match.

Example:
```bash
grep -C 2 'failure' application.log
```
- Displays 2 lines before and after each line containing "failure".

---

### Regular Expressions

`grep` supports regular expressions (regex) for powerful pattern matching:

1. **Basic Regular Expressions (BRE)**  
   - By default, `grep` uses a simplified syntax.  
   - Example: `grep 'c.t' file` matches "cat", "cut", "c t", etc.

2. **Extended Regular Expressions (ERE)**  
   - Use `egrep` or `grep -E` to enable extended features, like `+`, `?`, and grouping without escaping:
   ```bash
   grep -E 'hello|world' file.txt
   ```
   - Matches lines containing either "hello" or "world".

3. **Escaping Special Characters**  
   - Some characters (`.`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `|`, etc.) have special meanings.  
   - Escape them with a backslash `\` if you want a literal match.

---

### Other Useful Options

- **`-l`**: Print the names of files with matches, rather than the matches themselves.  
  ```bash
  grep -l 'TODO' *.c
  ```
- **`-c`**: Print the count of matching lines instead of the lines themselves.  
  ```bash
  grep -c 'error' app.log
  ```
- **`-o`**: Print only the matching part of the line, not the entire line.  
  ```bash
  grep -o '[0-9]\+' data.txt
  ```
  (Finds sequences of digits.)

---

### Examples

1. **Search Case-Insensitive in a Single File**  
   ```bash
   grep -i 'warning' server.log
   ```
2. **Find All Occurrences in Multiple Files**  
   ```bash
   grep 'TODO' *.py
   ```
3. **Search Recursively in a Directory**  
   ```bash
   grep -r 'DEBUG' /var/log/
   ```
4. **Show Matches with Line Numbers**  
   ```bash
   grep -n 'function' main.c
   ```
5. **Only Print Filenames with Matches**  
   ```bash
   grep -l 'ERROR' /var/log/*.log
   ```
6. **Show Context Around Matches**  
   ```bash
   grep -A 3 'timeout' application.log
   ```

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Use Quotes**: Enclose patterns in single quotes to avoid shell interpretation of special characters.  
- **Leverage Regular Expressions**: Mastering regex can significantly enhance your searching power.  
- **Large Files**: For very large files, consider combining `grep` with commands like `less` or `tail -f` for a more efficient workflow.  
- **Performance**: Recursive searches can be resource-intensive. Narrow the search by specifying file types or specific subdirectories if possible.  
- **Filtering vs. Parsing**: `grep` is great for filtering lines, but if you need structured parsing or multi-line patterns, other tools like `awk`, `sed`, or more specialized scripts might be more appropriate.
