### Overview

The `passwd` command is used to change or manage passwords for user accounts on a Unix-like system. By default, running `passwd` without arguments changes your own password. If you have appropriate privileges (usually via `sudo`), you can change other users’ passwords as well.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
passwd
```
- Prompts for your current password (if needed), then asks you to enter and confirm a new password.

---

### Changing Your Own Password

1. **Run the Command**  
   ```bash
   passwd
   ```
2. **Enter Current Password**  
   - If required, you’ll be prompted to authenticate.  
3. **Enter New Password**  
   - Must meet any system-imposed complexity rules (e.g., minimum length or presence of special characters).  
4. **Re-enter New Password**  
   - Confirm the new password to ensure there are no typos.

---

### Changing Another User’s Password

```bash
sudo passwd <username>
```
- Requires `sudo` privileges or root access.
- Useful for system administrators who need to reset user passwords.

Example:
```bash
sudo passwd alice
```
- Resets the password for `alice`.

---

### Password Complexity

The exact rules depend on your system configuration and PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) settings. Common requirements might include:

- Minimum length (e.g., 8 characters)
- At least one uppercase character
- At least one digit or symbol
- Avoid easily guessable passwords (e.g., dictionary words, repeated characters)

If your password doesn’t meet these standards, `passwd` may reject it and prompt you to try again.

### Advanced Usage and Options

1. **Force User to Change Password on Next Login**  
   ```bash
   sudo passwd -e <username>
   ```
   - Sets the user’s password to expire, so they must choose a new one on their next login.

2. **Lock or Unlock an Account**  
   - **Lock**:  
     ```bash
     sudo passwd -l <username>
     ```
     Prevents the user from logging in using their password (doesn’t affect SSH keys if configured).  
   - **Unlock**:  
     ```bash
     sudo passwd -u <username>
     ```
     Reverses the lock.

3. **View Account Password Status**  
   ```bash
   sudo passwd -S <username>
   ```
   - Shows whether the account is locked, when the password was last changed, and when it expires.

### Examples

1. **Change Your Own Password**  
   ```bash
   passwd
   ```
   Walks you through prompts for old and new passwords.

2. **Reset Another User’s Password**  
   ```bash
   sudo passwd bob
   ```
   Sets or changes the password for user `bob`.

3. **Force Password Change**  
   ```bash
   sudo passwd -e bob
   ```
   Bob must set a new password upon next login.

4. **Lock a User Account**  
   ```bash
   sudo passwd -l bob
   ```
   Prevents Bob from logging in with his password.

5. **Check Password Status**  
   ```bash
   sudo passwd -S bob
   ```
   Displays current lock status, last change date, and expiration info.

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Use Strong Passwords**: Long, random passwords are more secure. Consider passphrases (e.g., several random words) for better memorability and strength.
- **Password Security**: Don’t reuse passwords across systems. Change them periodically if required by policy, but avoid frequent forced rotations that can lead to weaker choices.
- **Lock Inactive Accounts**: If a user no longer needs access, locking or removing their account is safer than leaving it with a known default password.
- **Check PAM Settings**: For advanced password rules (like complexity or history), inspect your PAM configuration (e.g., `/etc/pam.d/common-password` on Debian-based distros).
- **Automation**: Scripting password changes is possible but risky. Always handle credentials securely—never store plaintext passwords in logs or scripts.
