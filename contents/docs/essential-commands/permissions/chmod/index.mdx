### Overview

The `chmod` command (short for *change mode*) modifies file or directory permissions. In Unix-like systems, permissions determine who can read, write, or execute a file or directory.

- **Owner (u)**: The person who owns the file.
- **Group (g)**: Other users who belong to the file’s group.
- **Others (o)**: Everyone else on the system.

Each permission is represented by one of three letters:
- **r** for *read*  
- **w** for *write*  
- **x** for *execute*  

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
chmod [options] mode file
```

- `mode` can be specified in **symbolic** or **numeric** (octal) notation.
- You can apply different modes to multiple files at once:  
  ```bash
  chmod 755 file1 file2 directory
  ```

---

### Symbolic Notation

Symbolic notation uses letters to represent operations. The general format is:

```bash
chmod [u/g/o/a][+/-/=][r/w/x] filename
```

1. **Entities**:  
   - **u** (user/owner)  
   - **g** (group)  
   - **o** (others)  
   - **a** (all: user, group, and others)

2. **Operators**:  
   - **+** (adds a permission)  
   - **-** (removes a permission)  
   - **=** (sets exact permissions)

3. **Permissions**:  
   - **r** (read)  
   - **w** (write)  
   - **x** (execute)

Examples:
```bash
# Give the owner execute permission
chmod u+x script.sh

# Remove write permission from group
chmod g-w document.txt

# Give read permission to everyone
chmod a+r notes.md

# Set file so that only the owner can read, write, and execute; remove all perms for others
chmod u=rwx,go= file.sh
```

---

### Numeric (Octal) Notation

Numeric notation uses three digits, each ranging from 0 to 7, representing **owner**, **group**, and **others**, in that order:

| Permission | Octal Value |
|------------|-------------|
| ---        | 0           |
| --x        | 1           |
| -w-        | 2           |
| -wx        | 3           |
| r--        | 4           |
| r-x        | 5           |
| rw-        | 6           |
| rwx        | 7           |

So `chmod 755 file` means:
- **7** (rwx) for the owner
- **5** (r-x) for the group
- **5** (r-x) for others

Examples:
```bash
# rwxr-xr-x
chmod 755 file.sh

# rw-r--r--
chmod 644 document.txt

# rwxrwxrwx (full permissions for everyone)
chmod 777 public_script.sh
```

### Directories vs. Files

- For **directories**, the **x** permission allows you to enter the directory and list its contents. Without it, you can’t `cd` into that directory.
- For **files**, **x** means you can execute the file as a program or script.

---

### Special Modes (Setuid, Setgid, Sticky Bit)

In addition to basic permissions, `chmod` can set special bits:
1. **Setuid (4xxx)**: When an executable file with setuid is run, it executes with the privileges of the file’s owner.  
2. **Setgid (2xxx)**: For directories, new files inherit the group ownership of the directory. For executables, they run with the file’s group privileges.  
3. **Sticky Bit (1xxx)**: Commonly used on directories like `/tmp`; users can only remove or rename files they own.

Example for setting a directory’s setgid bit:
```bash
chmod g+s shared_folder
```
Or in numeric notation (using `2` for setgid):
```bash
chmod 2775 shared_folder
```

---

### Common Options

- **`-R` (recursive)**: Apply permissions to all subdirectories and files.
  ```bash
  chmod -R 755 /path/to/directory
  ```
- **`-v` (verbose)**: Show which files are being changed.
  ```bash
  chmod -v 644 *.txt
  ```
- **`-c` (changes)**: Like verbose, but only reports changes that were actually made (no output if nothing changed).

---

### Examples

1. **Make a Script Executable**  
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```
   (Equivalent to `chmod u+x script.sh`)

2. **Restrict Access to Owner Only**  
   ```bash
   chmod 700 secrets.txt
   ```
   Gives the owner full access, no permissions for group or others.

3. **Grant Read/Write to Owner and Group**  
   ```bash
   chmod 660 data.csv
   ```
   Owner and group can read/write, others have no permission.

4. **Add Execute Permission to Everyone**  
   ```bash
   chmod a+x run.sh
   ```
   Now any user can run `run.sh`.

5. **Recursively Set Permissions**  
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 public_html
   ```
   All files in `public_html` become readable/executable by all, writable only by owner.

6. **Set the Sticky Bit**  
   ```bash
   chmod 1777 /var/shared
   ```
   Only the owner of a file can delete or rename it, even if others have write access.

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Double-Check Before 777**: Granting `rwx` to everyone can create security risks. Make sure it’s necessary before using `chmod 777`.  
- **Symbolic vs Numeric**: Symbolic notation is often easier to remember for small changes (`u+x`, etc.), while numeric notation is great for quickly setting complete permissions.  
- **Directories Need Execute**: Remember that to traverse a directory, you need execute (`x`) permission on it.  
- **Scripts and Execution**: For a script to be run directly (`./script.sh`), it must be executable. Otherwise, you must call it via an interpreter (`bash script.sh`).  
- **Check Ownership**: Permissions alone don’t override file ownership. If you don’t own a file (or aren’t in the correct group), you may need `sudo` to change permissions.
