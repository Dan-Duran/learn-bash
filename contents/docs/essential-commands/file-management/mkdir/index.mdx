### Overview

The `mkdir` (make directory) command creates one or more directories in your file system. It’s a straightforward yet crucial tool when organizing files or setting up a project structure.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
mkdir dirname
```
- Creates a directory named `dirname` in the current working directory.

```bash
mkdir /path/to/dirname
```
- Creates a directory at the specified absolute path.

---

### Creating Multiple Directories

You can create multiple directories with one command:
```bash
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
```
- Creates `dir1`, `dir2`, and `dir3` within your current directory.

---

### Parent Directories (`-p`)

Use the `-p` (parents) option to create nested directories without manually creating each parent directory first:
```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/subdir
```
- If `/path/to` doesn’t exist, it will create all necessary parent directories.

---

### Verifying Creation (`-v`)

Use the `-v` (verbose) option for visual confirmation:
```bash
mkdir -v dirname
```
- Prints a message for each directory created. Useful when you’re making multiple directories at once.

---

### Error Handling

1. **Directory Already Exists**  
   If you try to create a directory that already exists, `mkdir` will throw an error unless you use the `-p` option, which silently ignores existing directories.

2. **Permissions**  
   If you don’t have permissions in the target location, you’ll receive a “Permission denied” error. You may need `sudo` or adjust directory permissions.

---

### Custom Permissions (`-m`)

You can specify permissions (in octal notation) for newly created directories with the `-m` (mode) option:
```bash
mkdir -m 755 dirname
```
- Sets directory permissions to `rwxr-xr-x`. 
- If omitted, the permissions are determined by the default `umask` of your system.

---

### Examples

1. **Creating a Single Directory**  
   ```bash
   mkdir my_project
   ```

2. **Creating Multiple Directories**  
   ```bash
   mkdir docs images scripts
   ```

3. **Nested Directories with Parents**  
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /home/dan/projects/bash/guide
   ```
   Ensures all intermediate directories (`projects`, `bash`) are created.

4. **Creating a Directory with Custom Permissions**  
   ```bash
   mkdir -m 700 private_folder
   ```
   Gives the owner full access, and no permissions to others.

5. **Verbose Creation**  
   ```bash
   mkdir -v -p /var/www/app/{logs,uploads}
   ```
   - Creates nested directories and shows a line of output for each one.
   - The curly braces are a shell expansion shortcut to create both `/var/www/app/logs` and `/var/www/app/uploads`.

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Use `ls` to Confirm**  
  After creating a directory, you can run `ls` to ensure it’s been created successfully.  
- **Combine with Other Commands**  
  Often used with commands like `cp` or `mv` to organize files into newly created directories.  
- **Automation**  
  In scripts, use `mkdir -p` to avoid errors if the directory already exists.
