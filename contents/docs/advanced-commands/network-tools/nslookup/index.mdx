### Overview

The `nslookup` command is a network utility used to query Domain Name System (DNS) servers for resolving domain names to IP addresses and retrieving various DNS records. It is widely used for troubleshooting DNS-related issues, verifying DNS configurations, and gathering information about DNS records.

**Key Features:**
- Resolve domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.
- Retrieve DNS records like A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, NS, and TXT.
- Test and troubleshoot DNS server configurations.
- Query specific DNS servers.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
nslookup [OPTIONS] [DOMAIN]
```

- **DOMAIN**: The domain name or IP address to query.
- **OPTIONS**: Flags to modify the behavior of the command.

**Example:**
```bash
nslookup example.com
```
- Resolves the IP address of `example.com` using the system's default DNS server.

---

### Interactive Mode

Launch `nslookup` in interactive mode by entering the command without any arguments:
```bash
nslookup
```

In interactive mode, you can issue multiple queries without restarting the command. To exit, type `exit`.

---

### Common Options and Commands

1. **Query a Domain**
   ```bash
   nslookup example.com
   ```
   - Resolves the IP address of `example.com`.

2. **Query a Specific DNS Server**
   ```bash
   nslookup example.com 8.8.8.8
   ```
   - Resolves `example.com` using Google's public DNS server (`8.8.8.8`).

3. **Reverse DNS Lookup**
   ```bash
   nslookup 93.184.216.34
   ```
   - Resolves the IP address `93.184.216.34` to its domain name.

4. **Retrieve Specific Record Types**
   - **Interactive Mode:**
     ```bash
     > set type=MX
     > example.com
     ```
   - **Non-Interactive Mode:**
     ```bash
     nslookup -type=MX example.com
     ```
   - Retrieves the mail exchange (MX) records for `example.com`.

5. **Change DNS Server in Interactive Mode**
   ```bash
   > server 1.1.1.1
   ```
   - Queries DNS using Cloudflare's server (`1.1.1.1`).

6. **Debug Mode**
   ```bash
   nslookup -debug example.com
   ```
   - Outputs detailed DNS query information for troubleshooting.

7. **Set Timeout**
   ```bash
   > set timeout=5
   ```
   - Sets the timeout for DNS queries to 5 seconds.

8. **Disable Recursion**
   ```bash
   > set norecurse
   ```
   - Sends a non-recursive query to the DNS server.

---

### Examples

1. **Basic Domain Lookup**
   ```bash
   nslookup example.com
   ```

2. **Query Using a Specific DNS Server**
   ```bash
   nslookup example.com 8.8.8.8
   ```

3. **Retrieve MX Records**
   ```bash
   nslookup -type=MX example.com
   ```

4. **Reverse Lookup**
   ```bash
   nslookup 93.184.216.34
   ```

5. **Debug DNS Query**
   ```bash
   nslookup -debug example.com
   ```

6. **Retrieve TXT Records**
   ```bash
   nslookup -type=TXT example.com
   ```

7. **Query Nameservers**
   ```bash
   nslookup -type=NS example.com
   ```

8. **Interactive Mode Example**
   ```bash
   nslookup
   > server 8.8.8.8
   > set type=AAAA
   > example.com
   > exit
   ```

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Use Specific DNS Servers for Testing**: Specify DNS servers like Google (`8.8.8.8`) or Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`) to verify resolutions across different providers.
  ```bash
  nslookup example.com 8.8.8.8
  ```

- **Check Reverse DNS Configurations**: Use reverse lookups to verify PTR records for IP addresses.
  ```bash
  nslookup 192.168.1.1
  ```

- **Retrieve Record Types Explicitly**: Use `-type` to query specific DNS records (e.g., `A`, `MX`, `TXT`).
  ```bash
  nslookup -type=TXT example.com
  ```

- **Debug DNS Issues**: Use the `-debug` option to analyze DNS queries and responses in detail.
  ```bash
  nslookup -debug example.com
  ```

- **Test Non-Recursive Queries**: Disable recursion for authoritative server testing.
  ```bash
  nslookup
  > set norecurse
  > example.com
  ```

- **Combine with Scripts**: Automate DNS lookups by integrating `nslookup` into shell scripts for bulk queries.

- **Verify Email Settings**: Check MX records to troubleshoot email delivery issues.
  ```bash
  nslookup -type=MX example.com
  ```

- **Test DNS Propagation**: Query different DNS servers to verify changes have propagated.
  ```bash
  nslookup example.com 1.1.1.1
  ```

- **Use Alternative Tools**: While `nslookup` is widely used, consider `dig` for more detailed output and flexibility.
  ```bash
  dig example.com
  ```
