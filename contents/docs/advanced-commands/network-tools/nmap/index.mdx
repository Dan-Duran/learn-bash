### Overview

The `nmap` (Network Mapper) command is a powerful and flexible open-source tool for network discovery, management, and security auditing. It can scan networks to identify hosts, open ports, services, operating systems, and potential vulnerabilities. `nmap` is widely used by system administrators, network engineers, and security professionals for troubleshooting and penetration testing.

**Key Features:**
- **Host Discovery**: Detect live hosts in a network.
- **Port Scanning**: Identify open ports and running services.
- **Service and Version Detection**: Determine the software version of services.
- **Operating System Detection**: Guess the operating system of hosts.
- **Scriptable Engine**: Run custom scripts for vulnerability detection and information gathering.
- **Flexible Output Formats**: Export results in XML, JSON, or plain text.

### Basic Usage

```bash
nmap [OPTIONS] [TARGET]
```

- **TARGET**: The IP address, hostname, or subnet to scan.
- **OPTIONS**: Flags to modify the scan behavior.

**Example:**
```bash
nmap example.com
```
- Scans the `example.com` host for open ports.

---

### Common Options

1. **Host Discovery**
   ```bash
   nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
   ```
   - Performs a ping scan to discover live hosts in the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet.

2. **Port Scanning**
   ```bash
   nmap -p 22,80,443 example.com
   ```
   - Scans ports `22`, `80`, and `443` on `example.com`.

3. **Service and Version Detection**
   ```bash
   nmap -sV example.com
   ```
   - Identifies services and their versions running on open ports.

4. **Operating System Detection**
   ```bash
   nmap -O example.com
   ```
   - Attempts to detect the target's operating system.

5. **Aggressive Scan**
   ```bash
   nmap -A example.com
   ```
   - Combines service detection, OS detection, and traceroute.

6. **Scan Specific IP Range**
   ```bash
   nmap 192.168.1.1-50
   ```
   - Scans hosts from `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.50`.

7. **Output Options**
   - Save results to a file:
     ```bash
     nmap -oN output.txt example.com
     ```
   - Save results in XML format:
     ```bash
     nmap -oX output.xml example.com
     ```

8. **Script Scanning**
   ```bash
   nmap --script=vuln example.com
   ```
   - Runs vulnerability detection scripts against `example.com`.

9. **Scan Stealthily**
   ```bash
   nmap -sS example.com
   ```
   - Performs a stealthy SYN scan.

10. **UDP Scanning**
    ```bash
    nmap -sU example.com
    ```
    - Scans for open UDP ports.

### Examples

1. **Basic Host Scan**
   ```bash
   nmap example.com
   ```
   - Scans `example.com` for open ports.

2. **Scan a Subnet**
   ```bash
   nmap 192.168.1.0/24
   ```
   - Discovers live hosts in the `192.168.1.0/24` network.

3. **Detect Services and Versions**
   ```bash
   nmap -sV example.com
   ```
   - Identifies services and versions running on the target.

4. **Scan All Ports**
   ```bash
   nmap -p- example.com
   ```
   - Scans all 65,535 TCP ports on `example.com`.

5. **Perform an Aggressive Scan**
   ```bash
   nmap -A example.com
   ```
   - Combines OS detection, service detection, and traceroute.

6. **Check for Vulnerabilities**
   ```bash
   nmap --script=vuln example.com
   ```
   - Runs preloaded vulnerability detection scripts.

7. **Save Results to a File**
   ```bash
   nmap -oN scan_results.txt example.com
   ```
   - Saves the scan results in a readable text file.

8. **Perform a Stealth Scan**
   ```bash
   nmap -sS example.com
   ```
   - Scans the target using SYN packets for stealth.

9. **Scan with Custom Scripts**
   ```bash
   nmap --script=http-title example.com
   ```
   - Retrieves the title of web pages hosted on `example.com`.

10. **Bypass Firewalls with Fragmented Packets**
    ```bash
    nmap -f example.com
    ```
    - Sends fragmented packets to evade simple firewalls.

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Run as Root for Advanced Features**: Many `nmap` options, like SYN scans or OS detection, require root privileges.
  ```bash
  sudo nmap -sS example.com
  ```

- **Use Specific Targets**: Avoid scanning broad ranges unnecessarily to reduce load and avoid legal issues.

- **Save Results**: Use output options (`-oN`, `-oX`, etc.) to store scan results for later analysis.
  ```bash
  nmap -oN results.txt example.com
  ```

- **Leverage NSE Scripts**: The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) provides powerful scripts for vulnerability detection, malware scans, and service enumeration.
  ```bash
  nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers example.com
  ```

- **Stealth Scanning**: Use `-sS` for stealthy scans to minimize detection by intrusion detection systems (IDS).

- **Scan Safely**: Always obtain permission before scanning networks or hosts you do not own.

- **Use `nmap` for Reconnaissance**: Combine with other tools like `metasploit` or `Wireshark` for penetration testing workflows.

- **Understand Rate Limits**: Adjust the scan speed (`-T1` to `-T5`) to avoid being flagged by rate-limiting systems.
  ```bash
  nmap -T4 example.com
  ```

- **Check Firewall Rules**: Use `--reason` to identify why certain ports are open or closed.
  ```bash
  nmap --reason example.com
  ```

- **Stay Updated**: Regularly update `nmap` to access the latest scripts and features.
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap
  ```

- **Combine with Ping**: Use `-sn` for a quick ping sweep of a subnet.
  ```bash
  nmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24
  ```

- **Respect Network Policies**: Scanning can be intrusive. Ensure scans comply with local and organizational policies.
