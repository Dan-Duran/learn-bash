### Overview

The `mtr` (My Traceroute) command is a dynamic network diagnostic tool that combines the functionality of `traceroute` and `ping`. It provides real-time insights into the route packets take to reach a target host and measures the latency and packet loss at each hop. `mtr` is invaluable for diagnosing network performance issues, identifying bottlenecks, and troubleshooting connectivity problems.

**Key Features:**
- **Real-Time Updates**: Continuously displays network path changes and latency metrics.
- **Packet Loss Analysis**: Highlights hops where packet loss occurs.
- **Customizable Output**: Provides detailed statistics and supports text or graphical interfaces.
- **Multiple Protocol Support**: Works with ICMP (default), UDP, or TCP.

### Basic Usage

```bash
mtr [OPTIONS] HOST
```

- **HOST**: The target hostname or IP address to analyze.
- **OPTIONS**: Flags to modify the behavior of `mtr`.

**Example:**
```bash
mtr example.com
```
- Displays the network path to `example.com` in real-time.

---

### Common Options

1. **`--report`**
   ```bash
   mtr --report example.com
   ```
   - Runs `mtr` for a specified number of cycles and outputs a summary report instead of real-time updates.

2. **`--report-cycles <N>`**
   ```bash
   mtr --report --report-cycles 5 example.com
   ```
   - Runs `mtr` for `N` cycles (e.g., `5`) and generates a report.

3. **`-n`**
   ```bash
   mtr -n example.com
   ```
   - Disables DNS resolution, displaying IP addresses only.

4. **`-r` (Report Mode)**
   ```bash
   mtr -r example.com
   ```
   - Outputs a one-time report in text format.

5. **`-c <N>`**
   ```bash
   mtr -c 10 example.com
   ```
   - Sets the number of pings (cycles) to send for each hop.

6. **`-i <SECONDS>`**
   ```bash
   mtr -i 2 example.com
   ```
   - Sets the interval between ICMP requests in seconds.

7. **`-p`**
   ```bash
   mtr -p example.com
   ```
   - Uses privileged mode for more accurate results (requires `sudo`).

8. **`-4` / `-6`**
   ```bash
   mtr -4 example.com
   ```
   - Forces the use of IPv4 (`-4`) or IPv6 (`-6`).

9. **`--tcp`**
   ```bash
   mtr --tcp example.com
   ```
   - Uses TCP packets instead of the default ICMP.

10. **`--udp`**
    ```bash
    mtr --udp example.com
    ```
    - Uses UDP packets instead of the default ICMP.

### Examples

1. **Run a Real-Time Trace**
   ```bash
   mtr example.com
   ```
   - Continuously displays the route to `example.com` with real-time updates.

2. **Generate a Summary Report**
   ```bash
   mtr --report example.com
   ```
   - Outputs a concise summary of the route.

3. **Run with IPv6**
   ```bash
   mtr -6 ipv6.example.com
   ```
   - Traces the route using IPv6.

4. **Trace Without DNS Resolution**
   ```bash
   mtr -n example.com
   ```
   - Displays only IP addresses, avoiding potential delays from DNS lookups.

5. **Use TCP Packets**
   ```bash
   mtr --tcp example.com
   ```
   - Sends TCP packets to test routes where ICMP might be blocked.

6. **Limit to 5 Cycles**
   ```bash
   mtr --report --report-cycles 5 example.com
   ```
   - Runs 5 cycles and outputs a report.

7. **Set a 2-Second Interval Between Probes**
   ```bash
   mtr -i 2 example.com
   ```
   - Sends probes every 2 seconds.

8. **Run as Root for Privileged Mode**
   ```bash
   sudo mtr -p example.com
   ```
   - Uses privileged mode for accurate latency and packet loss data.

9. **Trace a Route Using UDP**
   ```bash
   mtr --udp example.com
   ```
   - Sends UDP packets instead of ICMP.

10. **Analyze a Specific Number of Hops**
    ```bash
    mtr --max-ttl 10 example.com
    ```
    - Limits the analysis to the first 10 hops.

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Run as Root for Accurate Results**: Use `sudo` to enable privileged mode for more accurate latency and loss measurements.
  ```bash
  sudo mtr example.com
  ```

- **Avoid DNS Delays**: Use the `-n` option to skip DNS resolution, speeding up results and avoiding potential false metrics caused by slow DNS lookups.
  ```bash
  mtr -n example.com
  ```

- **Save Reports**: Redirect `mtr` output to a file for logging or sharing.
  ```bash
  mtr --report example.com > mtr_report.txt
  ```

- **Test Using TCP for Firewalled Hosts**: Many networks block ICMP. Use `--tcp` to simulate typical application traffic for more realistic diagnostics.
  ```bash
  mtr --tcp example.com
  ```

- **Monitor Packet Loss**: Pay attention to packet loss percentages at each hop to identify potential bottlenecks or issues.

- **Analyze Long-Term Behavior**: Run `mtr` with a high number of cycles (`-c`) to observe long-term trends in latency and packet loss.
  ```bash
  mtr --report --report-cycles 100 example.com
  ```

- **Use with Scripts for Automation**: Integrate `mtr` into scripts to automate network monitoring and diagnostics.

- **Combine with Other Tools**: Pair `mtr` with tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `tcpdump` for comprehensive network troubleshooting.

- **Interpret Output Carefully**: Packet loss at intermediate hops is not always an issue; some routers deprioritize ICMP packets for performance reasons.

- **Use `mtr` on Both Ends for Bi-Directional Testing**: Running `mtr` from both source and target hosts provides a complete picture of network performance.
