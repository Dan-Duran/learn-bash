### What to Expect

This section covers advanced Bash commands and operators that will significantly enhance your command-line capabilities. These tools are organized into logical categories to help you better understand their purposes and relationships:

### I/O Redirection & Operators
Master the flow of data between commands and files using operators like pipes (`|`), output redirection (`>`), and various other control operators. These form the foundation of command chaining and data manipulation.

### Text Processing Tools
Learn powerful text manipulation commands like `sed`, `awk`, and `xargs`. These tools excel at parsing, filtering, and transforming text data, making them essential for log analysis and data processing.

### Remote Operations
Discover secure ways to interact with remote systems using `ssh`, `scp`, and `rsync`. These tools enable secure file transfers and remote system management.

### Process Control
Manage running processes effectively with terminal multiplexers (`screen`, `tmux`) and job control commands (`bg`, `fg`, `jobs`). Perfect for handling long-running tasks and multiple terminal sessions.

### File Operations
Explore advanced file manipulation with tools like `dd` for disk operations, `diff` for file comparison, and `ln` for creating links. These commands provide precise control over file system operations.

### System Monitoring
Gain deep insights into system behavior using tools like `strace` for system calls, `vmstat` for virtual memory statistics, and `iostat` for I/O monitoring.

### Network Tools
Master network diagnostics and management with tools ranging from basic connectivity testing to advanced network scanning and monitoring.

Each category builds upon basic commands to provide more sophisticated capabilities for system administration, automation, and troubleshooting.
