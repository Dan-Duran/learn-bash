### Overview

`sed` (stream editor) is a powerful command-line utility for text manipulation and filtering. It reads input line by line (stream) and applies editing rules — such as substitutions, insertions, or deletions — without modifying the original file unless you specifically instruct it to.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
sed 's/pattern/replacement/' file
```
- **s**: Substitute command
- **pattern**: The text to find
- **replacement**: What to replace the pattern with
- Applies to the first match in each line of `file`

```bash
sed 's/pattern/replacement/g' file
```
- The `g` flag replaces **all** occurrences in each line, instead of only the first occurrence.

**Example**:
```bash
sed 's/Dan/Robert/' names.txt
```
- Replaces the first instance of “Dan” per line with “Robert”.

### Common Flags and Options

1. **`-i` (in-place editing)**  
   ```bash
   sed -i 's/old/new/g' file
   ```
   Modifies the file directly, without sending output to stdout.  
   Use with caution, or make a backup:
   ```bash
   sed -i.bak 's/old/new/g' file
   ```
   Creates `file.bak` as a backup.

2. **`-n` (suppress automatic printing)**  
   ```bash
   sed -n 's/pattern/replacement/p' file
   ```
   Prints only lines where the substitution took place, ignoring all others.

3. **`-r` or `-E` (extended regex)**  
   ```bash
   sed -r 's/([0-9]+) items/Items: \1/' file
   ```
   Lets you use extended regular expressions (like `+`, `?`, `|`) without escaping them.  
   Some `sed` implementations use `-E` instead of `-r`.

4. **Addresses**  
   ```bash
   sed '2s/foo/bar/' file
   ```
   Applies the substitution only to line 2 of `file`.  
   ```bash
   sed '1,5s/foo/bar/' file
   ```
   Applies substitution from line 1 to line 5.  
   ```bash
   sed '/pattern/ s/foo/bar/' file
   ```
   Applies substitution only on lines matching `pattern`.

### Common Use Cases

1. **Global Search and Replace**  
   ```bash
   sed 's/Cat/Dog/g' animals.txt
   ```
   Changes every “Cat” into “Dog” on each line of `animals.txt`.

2. **Case-Insensitive Replace**  
   ```bash
   sed 's/dan/robert/Ig' names.txt
   ```
   - **I**: Case-insensitive  
   - **g**: Global (all matches per line)

3. **Delete Lines Matching a Pattern**  
   ```bash
   sed '/ERROR/d' logfile.txt
   ```
   Removes every line containing “ERROR”.

4. **Print Specific Lines**  
   ```bash
   sed -n '10,20p' file
   ```
   Shows only lines 10 through 20, ignoring the rest.

5. **Insert or Append Lines**  
   ```bash
   sed '3i This will be inserted above line 3' file
   ```
   - **i**: Insert text before the specified line number
   ```bash
   sed '5a This will be added after line 5' file
   ```
   - **a**: Append text after the line

6. **Remove Blank Lines**  
   ```bash
   sed '/^$/d' file
   ```
   Deletes lines that are completely empty.

7. **Multiple Commands**  
   ```bash
   sed -e 's/foo/bar/g' -e '/DEBUG/d' input.txt
   ```
   - **-e**: Add multiple editing commands
   - Replaces “foo” with “bar” and then removes lines containing “DEBUG”.

---

### Advanced Substitution

1. **Grouping & Backreferences**  
   ```bash
   sed 's/\(hello\) \(world\)/\2 \1/' file
   ```
   - Captures two groups, swapping their order.

2. **Extended Regex**  
   ```bash
   sed -r 's/([0-9]+)x([0-9]+)/Width: \1, Height: \2/' dimensions.txt
   ```
   - Extracts numeric values and rewrites them.

3. **Replace Delimiter**  
   ```bash
   sed 's:/usr/bin:/opt/bin:g' paths.txt
   ```
   - Instead of `/s/foo/bar/`, you can use `:`, `|`, or another character to avoid escaping slashes.

---

### Printing and Control

- **`p` (print)**: Used with `-n` to print only modified lines or matched lines.  
- **`d` (delete)**: Removes lines from the output entirely.  
- **`q` (quit)**: Stops processing after a certain condition.

**Example**:
```bash
sed -n '/pattern/{p;q}' file
```
- Prints the first occurrence of “pattern” and then quits (no further lines processed).

### Tips and Best Practices

- **In-Place Editing**: Always consider using a backup extension (`-i.bak`) or keep your original file safe.  
- **Regex Skills**: Sed is extremely powerful if you’re comfortable with regular expressions.  
- **Use Extended Regex**: `-r` or `-E` can make patterns much clearer without excessive backslashes.  
- **Test Before Overwriting**: Test your sed commands by printing results to stdout first, then apply `-i` for final changes.  
- **Alternative Tools**: For more complex multi-line transformations, `awk` or `perl` might be easier.  
- **Portability**: Some advanced features (`-r`, `-E`, certain flags) can vary between versions. Check which version of `sed` is on your system.
