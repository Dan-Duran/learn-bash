### Overview

Using the `>>` operator in Bash (and other Unix-like shells) redirects the standard output of a command to a file, **appending** the output to the file if it already exists (rather than overwriting). If the file doesn’t exist, it’s created.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
command >> file
```
- **command**: Any valid command whose output you want to record.
- **file**: The file where the output will be appended.

**Example**:
```bash
echo "New entry" >> log.txt
```
- If `log.txt` exists, adds “New entry” on a new line at the end of `log.txt`.
- If `log.txt` does not exist, it creates it and adds “New entry” as the first line.

---

### Important Details

1. **Appending vs. Overwriting**  
   - `>>` **appends** to a file.
   - `>` **overwrites** a file.
   - Be sure you use the correct operator to avoid accidental data loss.

2. **File Creation**  
   - If the file doesn’t exist, the shell creates it automatically with your current permissions.

3. **Standard Error**  
   - By default, `>>` redirects **standard output** (file descriptor 1).  
   - Errors (standard error, file descriptor 2) still appear in the terminal unless you merge the streams or redirect them separately.

4. **Permissions**  
   - You need write permission on the file (or in the directory if the file doesn’t exist yet).

### Examples

1. **Appending a Single Line**  
   ```bash
   echo "Backup completed at $(date)" >> backup.log
   ```
   Adds a timestamped entry to `backup.log` each time the command is run.

2. **Appending Command Output**  
   ```bash
   ls -l >> files_list.txt
   ```
   Adds the latest directory listing to the end of `files_list.txt`.  

3. **Appending Multiple Lines**  
   ```bash
   cat new_entries.txt >> main_database.txt
   ```
   If `new_entries.txt` contains several lines, they’re appended in bulk to `main_database.txt`.

4. **Appending with a Pipe**  
   ```bash
   grep "ERROR" /var/log/syslog | tail -n 10 >> errors_summary.txt
   ```
   Takes the last 10 “ERROR” lines from `syslog` and appends them to `errors_summary.txt`.

5. **Redirecting Only Standard Output**  
   ```bash
   ls nonexistent_directory >> output.txt
   ```
   Since `ls` will generate an error message to stderr, `output.txt` remains unchanged (the error still prints to terminal).

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Know the Difference**: Use `>>` when you need to **add** data at the end of a file. Use `>` if you want to replace the file contents entirely.
- **Check File Existence**: If you’re using `>>` in a script, it’s often safe because even if the file isn’t there, it’ll be created. Just confirm you have the right path.
- **Combining Streams**: To capture both stdout and stderr in append mode, you could do:
  ```bash
  command >> file 2>&1
  ```
  This appends both outputs to `file`. 
- **Logging**: `>>` is extremely useful for logging script actions or appending new records without losing historical data.
- **Permissions**: If you see “Permission denied” errors, verify you have write access to the file or directory.
