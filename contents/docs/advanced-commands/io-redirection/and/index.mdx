### Overview

In Bash (and many other shells), the **AND operator** (`&&`) allows you to chain commands so that the next command in the sequence runs **only if** the previous command completes successfully (exit status `0`). If any command in the chain fails (non-zero exit status), the shell stops executing further commands in that chain.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
command1 && command2
```
1. **command1** is executed first.
2. If `command1` succeeds (exit code `0`), then `command2` is executed.
3. If `command1` fails (exit code non-zero), `command2` is **skipped**.

**Example**:
```bash
mkdir new_project && cd new_project
```
- Creates a new directory called `new_project`.
- If the directory is created successfully, changes into it.
- If the `mkdir` command fails (e.g., the directory already exists and you don’t have permission), `cd new_project` is not executed.

---

### Why Use `&&`?

- **Conditional Execution**: Ensures you only run subsequent commands when earlier ones succeed.  
- **Cleaner than `if`**: For simple one-liner checks, `&&` avoids writing multi-line `if` statements.  
- **Automation**: Great in scripts to stop immediately on an error and not proceed with dependent operations.

---

### Multiple Commands

You can chain more than two commands:
```bash
command1 && command2 && command3 && command4
```
- Each command runs only if the previous commands return an exit status of `0`.

**Example**:
```bash
gcc main.c -o app && ./app && echo "Program ran successfully!"
```
- Compiles `main.c` to produce `app`.
- If compilation succeeds, runs `./app`.
- If `./app` also exits normally, prints a success message.

---

### Comparison with `;` and `||`

- **`;`** (semicolon): Runs commands sequentially **regardless** of success/failure.
  ```bash
  command1 ; command2
  ```
- **`&&`**: Runs the second command **only if** the first succeeds.
  ```bash
  command1 && command2
  ```
- **`||`**: Runs the second command **only if** the first fails.
  ```bash
  command1 || command2
  ```

You can mix them for more complex logic:
```bash
command1 && command2 || command3
```
- If `command1` succeeds, run `command2`. If `command2` fails, run `command3`.  
- If `command1` fails, skip `command2` and run `command3`.

### Examples

1. **Update and Install**  
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```
   - Upgrades the system only if the update step finishes without errors.

2. **Check, Then Execute**  
   ```bash
   [ -f script.sh ] && bash script.sh
   ```
   - Runs `script.sh` only if it exists (`[ -f script.sh ]` returns `0` if the file exists).

3. **Compile, Run, Notify**  
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o main && ./main && echo "All good!"
   ```
   - Only echoes “All good!” if both compilation and execution succeed.

4. **Create Directory and Enter It**  
   ```bash
   mkdir /tmp/test_dir && cd /tmp/test_dir
   ```
   - Changes directory only if the directory was created successfully.

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Short-Circuiting**: `&&` is sometimes called “short-circuit operator” because if a command fails, the chain stops immediately.
- **Check Exit Status**: Commands that exit with a non-zero status trigger the chain to halt. Make sure you know which exit codes represent success/failure for the commands you’re using.
- **Error Messages**: If you need to handle errors more gracefully, combine `&&` with `||` or explicit `if` statements to provide fallback or cleanup steps.
- **Readability**: Overusing chained operators can make code less readable. For complex logic, consider using `if` statements or writing a small script with error handling.
- **Scripting**: Useful when building ephemeral environments or deployments—e.g., `configure && make && make install`.
