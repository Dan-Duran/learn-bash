### Overview

In Bash, **`&>`** (or `&>>` for appending) is a shortcut for redirecting both **standard output** (file descriptor **1**) and **standard error** (file descriptor **2**) to the same destination. This is especially handy when you want to capture everything (all output and errors) into one place—typically a log file or for analysis.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
command &> file
```
- Runs `command` and sends **both** standard output and standard error to `file`.  
- **Overwrites** `file` if it exists.

```bash
command &>> file
```
- The **append** version, which adds new output to the existing file contents instead of overwriting.

**Example**:
```bash
ls -l /some/dir &> output.log
```
- Any successful output is written to `output.log`.
- Any error messages (like `Permission denied` or `No such file or directory`) also go to `output.log`.

---

### Why `&>`?

1. **Simplicity**: `&>` is shorter than writing `> file 2>&1`.  
2. **All-in-One**: You don’t need to separate your redirections for stdout and stderr.  
3. **Troubleshooting**: When capturing logs, having everything in one file can make it easier to see the complete picture.

---

### Equivalents in Bash

- **`> file 2>&1`**: The more explicit way to redirect both streams into the same file.  
- **`&> file`**: Bash shorthand for `> file 2>&1`.

For **append** mode:
- **`>> file 2>&1`** vs. **`&>> file`**.

---

### Examples

1. **Capture All Output**  
   ```bash
   find / -name "*.conf" &> search.log
   ```
   - Both matching results and errors (e.g., “Permission denied”) end up in `search.log`.

2. **Append**  
   ```bash
   command &>> combined.log
   ```
   - Adds new output (stdout and stderr) to `combined.log` each time you run the command.

3. **Command Chain**  
   ```bash
   (command1 && command2) &> everything.log
   ```
   - Runs `command1` and, if successful, `command2`. All messages from both commands go to `everything.log`.

4. **Piping with &>**  
   ```bash
   ls -l /nonexistent/ &> /dev/null | grep "pattern"
   ```
   - Careful: the `&>` is applied before the pipe. Errors are going to `/dev/null`; the pipe won’t receive anything. Usually, you’d want to do something like:
     ```bash
     ls -l /nonexistent/ 2>/dev/null | grep "pattern"
     ```
     if you only want to silence errors but still pipe normal output.

---

### Error vs. Output: Important Nuances

- `&>` merges **both** streams, so you can’t easily distinguish errors from normal output afterward (they’re all in one file).  
- If you need them separate, use:
  ```bash
  command > out.log 2> err.log
  ```

---

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Be Certain You Want Everything Together**: Once merged, you can’t separate stdout from stderr in the single file.  
- **Don’t Overuse**: If you only need to capture errors, consider `2> file`. If you only want normal output, use `> file`.  
- **Check Your Shell**: `&>` is a Bash extension. In strictly POSIX shells, you may need the more traditional `> file 2>&1`.  
- **Appending Logs**: Use `&>> logfile` if you want cumulative logs. Overwriting (`&> logfile`) can destroy valuable previous logs.  
- **Permissions**: Verify you have write permissions for the target file/directory. If you get “Permission denied,” your redirection won’t work as intended.
