### Overview

The **OR operator** (`||`) in Bash (and many other shells) allows you to chain commands so that the next command in the sequence is executed **only if** the previous command fails (i.e., returns a non-zero exit status). If the first command succeeds (exit code `0`), the next command is skipped.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
command1 || command2
```

1. **command1** runs first.
2. If `command1` returns a **non-zero** exit status (indicating error/failure), then **command2** executes.
3. If `command1` returns `0` (success), **command2** is **not** executed.

**Example**:
```bash
cd /nonexistent-directory || echo "Failed to enter directory!"
```
- Attempts to `cd` into a folder that doesn’t exist.
- If `cd` fails, Bash prints “Failed to enter directory!”.
- If somehow `cd` succeeded, it would skip the `echo`.

---

### Why Use `||`?

- **Error Handling**: Run an alternate command if the first command fails.  
- **Fallback**: Provide a fallback action when something didn’t go as planned.  
- **Concise**: For a simple “if fail then do something” logic, `||` can be shorter than an `if` statement.

---

### Comparison with `&&` and `;`

- **`&&` (AND)**: Runs the second command **only if** the first command **succeeds** (`exit code 0`).
  ```bash
  command1 && command2
  ```
- **`||` (OR)**: Runs the second command **only if** the first command **fails** (non-zero exit code).
  ```bash
  command1 || command2
  ```
- **`;` (semicolon)**: Runs the second command **unconditionally**, regardless of success or failure.
  ```bash
  command1 ; command2
  ```

---

### Multiple Commands

You can chain more than two commands:
```bash
command1 || command2 || command3
```
- If `command1` fails, `command2` will run.  
- If `command2` also fails, `command3` will run.  
- If any command succeeds, the chain stops there.

**Example**:
```bash
false || echo "First failed" || echo "Second also failed"
```
- `false` always returns a non-zero exit code, so `echo "First failed"` will run.
- If `echo` for some reason failed (which is unlikely), then the second echo would run.

---

### Examples

1. **Check Existence, Then Fallback**  
   ```bash
   [ -f important-file.txt ] || echo "File missing!"
   ```
   - If `important-file.txt` does not exist, prints “File missing!”.
   - If it does exist, does nothing.

2. **Try One Command, Then Another**  
   ```bash
   grep "pattern" file.txt || echo "Pattern not found"
   ```
   - If grep finds the pattern (exit code 0), it shows matches and the echo is skipped.
   - If grep fails to find matches (exit code non-zero), the echo command runs.

3. **Compile or Warn**  
   ```bash
   gcc program.c -o program || echo "Compilation failed!"
   ```
   - If compilation fails, prints “Compilation failed!”.

4. **Fallback Action**  
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/dir || cd /fallback/dir
   ```
   - If the first `cd` fails, attempts the fallback path.

5. **Stop Service or Complain**  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop myservice || echo "Failed to stop service!"
   ```
   - If `systemctl stop` fails (maybe the service doesn’t exist), prints a complaint.

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Exit Codes**: Know which commands produce which exit codes. `||` depends on non-zero exit codes to trigger the second command.
- **Error Messages**: This is a concise way to log errors. For more sophisticated error handling, you might use `if` statements or scripts with structured checks.
- **Short-Circuiting**: As soon as a command in the chain succeeds, subsequent `||` commands are skipped. This can be an efficient fallback mechanism.
- **Mix and Match**: Combine `||` with `&&` to build more complex logic:
  ```bash
  command1 && command2 || command3
  ```
  - If `command1` succeeds, run `command2`; if either fails, run `command3`.
- **Readability**: Long chains of `||` and `&&` can be confusing. For more intricate logic, consider an actual `if-else` structure in a script.
