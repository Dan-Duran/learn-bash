### Overview

In Bash and many other shells, the **semicolon** (`;`) allows you to place multiple commands on a single line, running them in sequence **regardless** of whether the previous command succeeds or fails. Each command separated by `;` runs unconditionally, one after the other.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
command1 ; command2
```

1. **command1** executes first.
2. Whether `command1` succeeds or fails, **command2** still executes afterward.

**Example**:
```bash
echo "Starting..." ; ls nonexistent_dir ; echo "Done."
```
- Displays “Starting…”
- Attempts to list `nonexistent_dir` (will likely fail and print an error)
- Then displays “Done.”  
Nothing stops the sequence—`ls` error does not prevent the final `echo` command.

---

### Comparison with `&&` and `||`

- **`;` (semicolon)**: Runs commands in sequence **unconditionally**.
  ```bash
  command1 ; command2
  ```
- **`&&`**: Runs the second command **only if** the first command succeeds (exit code `0`).
  ```bash
  command1 && command2
  ```
- **`||`**: Runs the second command **only if** the first command fails (exit code non-zero).
  ```bash
  command1 || command2
  ```

You can mix them for more complex logic, but be mindful of readability.

---

### Multiple Commands

You can place several commands in a row:
```bash
command1 ; command2 ; command3 ; command4
```
Each one executes in order:
1. `command1`  
2. `command2` (regardless of `command1`’s exit code)  
3. `command3` (regardless of previous successes/failures)  
4. `command4`, etc.

---

### Examples

1. **Unconditional Execution**  
   ```bash
   echo "Hello" ; echo "World"
   ```
   Prints “Hello” then “World” no matter what.

2. **Build and Remove**  
   ```bash
   make ; rm *.o
   ```
   Even if `make` fails, `.o` files are still removed.

3. **Update and Check**  
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```
   Runs upgrade whether or not `update` completes successfully.

4. **Mixing with `&&`**  
   ```bash
   mkdir newdir && cd newdir ; echo "Inside new directory"
   ```
   - `mkdir newdir && cd newdir`: only enter `newdir` if creation succeeds.
   - `; echo "Inside new directory"`: runs afterward no matter what.

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Unconditional Nature**: Remember that semicolon-chained commands ignore success or failure of previous commands. Use `&&` if you need conditional execution.
- **Readability**: For long command sequences, consider writing a script or using multiple lines instead of packing everything in one line.  
- **Logging and Cleanup**: If you need guaranteed cleanup tasks (e.g., removing temporary files) after a command—whether it succeeds or fails—a semicolon can be appropriate.  
- **Testing Exit Codes**: If you need different actions based on success or failure, use `&&` and `||`, or an `if` statement. `;` always proceeds, so it’s not suitable for error-dependent logic.
- **Scripting**: In scripts, you might see multiple semicolon-separated commands in a single line for brevity. However, too many commands in one line can reduce clarity.
